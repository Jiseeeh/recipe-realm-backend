You can also add a small amount of butter or oil to the pan to prevent the egg from sticking. Crack an egg into a small bowl or ramekin. This makes it easier to pour the egg into the pan without breaking the yolk. Once the pan is heated, carefully pour the egg into the pan. Be sure to pour it gently so that the yolk does not break. Let the egg cook for 1-2 minutes or until the white is set and the edges are slightly crispy. You can cover the pan with a lid to help cook the top of the egg if you prefer a more well-done yolk. Use a spatula to carefully remove the egg from the pan and onto a plate. Serve immediately while the yolk is still runny.','Egg\nSalt\nPepper\nOil')`,
